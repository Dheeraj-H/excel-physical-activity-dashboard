# User Activity & Retention Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

## Project Overview

based on their last activity date and calculates overall retention metrics.

The business goal is to understand user engagement and retention using SQL,
and visualize the results in Power BI.

## Power BI Dashboard
The SQL output is connected directly to Power BI to show:
- Total Users
- Active vs Inactive Users
- Retention Percentage
- User Distribution visuals

---

## Outcome
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis:
SQL data transformation → business logic → Power BI visualization.
